This air cushion can then provide adequate pressurization for all fluctuations of the system. Because air can be absorbed in water, some means of restricting the flow of cooler water from the tank into the system is needed without restricting the passage of air into the tank. Compression tank size can be reduced by reducing vapor pressure if this is achieved. The Airtrol can do this by allowing the air to rise in the tube into the top of the tank, but the water flow is restricted by a baffle or trap.</p>",2983709

This air cushion can then provide adequate pressurization for all fluctuations of the system. Because air can be absorbed in water, some means of restricting the flow of cooler water from the tank into the system is needed without restricting the passage of air into the tank. Compression tank size can be reduced by reducing vapor pressure if this is achieved. The Airtrol can do this by allowing the air to rise in into the top of the tank, but the water flow is restricted by a ball check or trap.</p>",2983916

Unlike a wet rotor, the Series PL does not need to bypass system water through the motor to lubricate and cool the bearings. The PL's advanced close-coupled design increases pump life and efficiency. The Series PL's stabilized heat-resistant, non-metallic impeller with a closed design improves overall operating efficiency. Unlike larger wet rotor circulators of similar performance, the Series PL is able to handle difficult water conditions at a wide range of temperatures.
