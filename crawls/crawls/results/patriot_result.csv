It differs from standard air separators (air scoops) because it has an internal diffuser and coalescing medium. The diffuser forces the system fluid to cover the entire inlet portion of the coalescing medium. Air bubbles or micro air bubbles will separate from the system fluid by coalescing to the medium with stainless steel wire-like hairs. The separated air rises to the top of the separator where it is vented to the atmosphere through an automatic air vent The Enhanced Air Separator comes ready for installation as a straight or angle pattern pipe design

	BELL &amp; GOSSETT CIRCUIT SENSOR FLOW METER 4"" FLANGED (MODEL OP-4A)  THE B&amp;G CIRCUIT SENSOR FLOW METER IS A PRECISION MACHINED WAFER-TYPE ORIFICE INSERT THAT IS INSTALLED BETWEEN STANDARD 125, 150, 250 OR 300 PSI ANSI FLANGES, TO MONITOR SYSTEM FLOW WITH A MINIMUM FRICTION HEAD LOSS.  SYSTEM FLOW IS DETERMINED BY OBTAINING A DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE ACROSS THE FLOW METER ORIFICE BY SENSING UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM PRESSURES THROUGH THE READOUT VALVES, THEN REFERRING TO THE CALIBRATED NAMEPLATE FOR THE CORRESPONDING FLOW.  CIRCUIT SENSOR FLOW METERS ARE SUITABLE FOR A MAXIMUM OPERATING TEMPERATURE OF 250ºF (121° C), AND ARE EQUIPPED WITH RV-125A READOUT VALVES FITTED WITH AN INTEGRAL EPT CHECK VALVE DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE SYSTEM FLUID LOSS DURING THE MONITORING PROCESS.

	BELL &amp; GOSSETT 100 BI IRON BODY CIRCULATOR (LESS FLANGES), 1/12 HP, 115 VOLT, WITH BRONZE IMPELLER.<br>THREE-PIECE, OIL LUBRICATED BOOSTER PUMP. The industry standard circulator for decades, Series 100 is still the one by which most others are judged. With well over 10 million units installed, the Series 100 remains a leader in applications such as hydronic heating and domestic hot water circulation. Series 100's three-piece, oil lubricated design provides for easy field service with bearings, shaft and seal all housed in an assembly which can be easily repaired or replaced. The Series 100 oil lubricated motor is specifically designed for the Series 100, and its resilient mounting provides quiet, dependable service with minimum annual lubrication. UL and CSA listings are standard. The design of this motor, coupled with its overall hydraulic performance, allows the Series 100 to overcome system related noise caused by valves, fittings, or piping.

With well over 10 million units installed, the Series 100 remains a leader in applications such as hydronic heating and domestic hot water circulation. Series 100's three-piece, oil lubricated design provides for easy field service with bearings, shaft and seal all housed in an assembly which can be easily repaired or replaced. The Series 100 oil lubricated motor is specifically designed for the Series 100, and its resilient mounting provides quiet, dependable service with minimum annual lubrication. UL and CSA listings are standard. The design of this motor, coupled with its overall hydraulic performance, allows the Series 100 to overcome system related noise caused by valves, fittings, or piping.

	BELL &amp; GOSSETT CIRCUIT SENSOR FLOW METER 5"" FLANGED (MODEL OP-5A)   THE B&amp;G CIRCUIT SENSOR FLOW METER IS A PRECISION MACHINED WAFER-TYPE ORIFICE INSERT THAT IS INSTALLED BETWEEN STANDARD 125, 150, 250 OR 300 PSI ANSI FLANGES, TO MONITOR SYSTEM FLOW WITH A MINIMUM FRICTION HEAD LOSS.  SYSTEM FLOW IS DETERMINED BY OBTAINING A DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE ACROSS THE FLOW METER ORIFICE BY SENSING UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM PRESSURES THROUGH THE READOUT VALVES, THEN REFERRING TO THE CALIBRATED NAMEPLATE FOR THE CORRESPONDING FLOW.  CIRCUIT SENSOR FLOW METERS ARE SUITABLE FOR A MAXIMUM OPERATING TEMPERATURE OF 250ºF (121° C), AND ARE EQUIPPED WITH RV-125A READOUT VALVES FITTED WITH AN INTEGRAL EPT CHECK VALVE DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE SYSTEM FLUID LOSS DURING THE MONITORING PROCESS.

The Series 60 features a three-piece design, which includes a motor, bearing assembly and volute. The Series 60's design has an internally, self-flushing mechanical seal, which provides superior flow circulation around the seal faces. This reduces heat buildup and increases particle removal. It also includes the XL-11 precision-crafted, permanently-lubricated, bearing system that ensures long life and quiet operation. All Series 60 pumps have ODP, open drip-proof, motor enclosures. Impellers are hydraulically balanced to provide smooth and efficient operation. The hydraulically balanced impeller and resilient motor also help provide smooth, quiet operation. The Series 60 611S is a single phase pump and features a bronze impeller.<br><br>Replaces: ***NOTE REPIPING MAY BE REQUIRED***<br>Bell &amp; Gossett 172718 (60-14S 2"" X 2"" X 5-1/4"" With 3/4 HP 1PH Motor)<br>Armstrong H-54, 116541-132 (With 3/4 HP 1PH Motor)<br>Taco 1622 (With 3/4 HP 1PH Motor)<br>Thrush GT-5 (With 3/4 HP 1PH Motor)
